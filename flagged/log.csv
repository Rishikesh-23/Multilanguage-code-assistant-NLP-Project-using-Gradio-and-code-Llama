Poem on topic Paneer Chilli in 200 words:
```
Paneer Chilli, a dish so divine
With flavors of saag and garlic, it's truly sublime
Creamy paneer, rich in taste
Saut√©ed with onions and ginger, it's a feast to behold

In the kitchen, we prepare with care
Dicing vegetables, adding spices galore
Chili powder, turmeric too
Cooking until the chilli is bubbly, through and through

Our families gather around the table
Enjoying this delicious dish, a feast to savor
With rice or naan, it's a meal fit for kings
Paneer Chilli, our hearts sing with joy
